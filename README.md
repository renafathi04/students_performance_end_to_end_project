# Student Performance Prediction

![project image](images\student_perfomace.webp)

This project is a machine learning application designed to predict student performance in exams based on various input features such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course, and reading/writing scores.

### Project Overview
The Student Performance Prediction system uses machine learning models to predict students' math scores based on multiple features related to their background and academic history. This system can help educators understand which factors are most influential on a studentâ€™s performance, helping guide interventions and improve educational outcomes.

### Dataset
The dataset contains information about students, including:

* Gender
* Race/Ethnicity
* Parental level of education
* Lunch (free/reduced/standard)
*  Test preparation course (none/completed)
* Reading score
* Writing score
These features are used to predict the math score of students.
